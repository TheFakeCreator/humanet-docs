# Humanet

## GitHub for Ideas + Notion for Structure + Obsidian's Knowledge Graph

**Humanet is a structured collaboration platform that treats ideas like code—with versioning, lifecycle management, quality validation, and knowledge graph connections.**

It's the missing layer between "I have an idea" and "Let's build it on GitHub."

> **Early Development Notice**
>
> Humanet is currently under active development. Not all features described in this documentation are available yet. The platform, AI validation, and web interface are being built. You can use the CLI and template to structure your ideas now, and full platform features will be released progressively.

## Quick Start

Get started in seconds with the Humanet CLI:

```bash
npx create-humanet
```

Or use the GitHub template:

<div className="mt-4 mb-6">
  <a href="https://github.com/TheFakeCreator/.humanet/generate" className="inline-block px-6 py-3 bg-blue-600 text-white font-semibold rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-700 transition-colors">
    Use Template on GitHub →
  </a>
</div>

## What Makes Humanet Different?

- **Structured Repositories** — Every idea lives as a repository with standardized documentation
- **Lifecycle Management** — Ideas progress through rigorous stages (Provisional → Validated → Active → Complete)
- **Idea Evolution** — Fork, branch, and merge ideas like code, creating a visible family tree
- **AI-Powered Validation** — Quality assurance without manual gatekeeping
- **Knowledge Graphs** — Backlinking connects related ideas and shows evolution
- **Domain Matching** — Connect ideas with people who have relevant expertise
- **Karma System** — Attributes value to all contribution types (not just code)

### [Idea Repositories](/concepts/idea-repositories)
Every idea exists as a structured repository with required documentation and optional artifacts.

### [Lifecycle Management](/concepts/lifecycle-management)
Ideas progress through clear states with AI-powered validation at each stage.

### [Idea Evolution](/concepts/idea-evolution)
Fork, branch, and merge ideas to create a visible genealogy of concepts.

### [Knowledge Graph](/concepts/knowledge-graph)
Bidirectional linking connects all artifacts and shows how ideas relate.

## Why Humanet?

Traditional collaboration platforms fall short:
- **GitHub** — Great for code, not for pre-code ideation
- **Notion/Docs** — Unstructured, no lifecycle management
- **Slack/Discord** — Ideas get lost in chat history
- **Research platforms** — Academic focus, poor for practical projects

**Humanet bridges the gap** — bringing code-like rigor to the ideation process.
