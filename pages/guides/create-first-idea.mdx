# Create Your First Idea

This step-by-step guide will walk you through creating your first idea repository on Humanet.

## Choose Your Method

### Quick Start (Recommended)

**Using the CLI - Takes 5 minutes:**

```bash
npx create-humanet
```

The interactive CLI will:
1. Ask you questions about your idea
2. Generate all required files automatically
3. Set up the proper folder structure
4. Provide validation commands

Skip to [Step 1: Identify Your Problem](#step-1-identify-your-problem) below to prepare, then run the CLI.

---

## Prerequisites

- A clear problem you want to solve
- Basic understanding of Markdown (or willingness to learn)
- 1-2 hours to draft initial documentation

## Step 1: Identify Your Problem

Before creating an idea, you need a clear problem to solve.

### Good Problems to Start With:

**Specific pain points you've experienced**
- "Task management tools don't integrate with my research workflow"
- "Finding relevant research papers is time-consuming"
- "Team knowledge gets lost in Slack conversations"

**Clearly defined scope**
- "Improve code review process for remote teams"
- "Streamline data collection for user research"
- "Automate deployment pipeline for static sites"

**Avoid problems that are too broad**
- "Fix education system"
- "Make the internet better"
- "Solve climate change"

**Action:** Write 2-3 sentences describing the problem you want to solve.

## Step 2: Initialize Your Idea

### Option A: Using CLI (Fast)

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder (or create a new one)
mkdir my-brilliant-idea
cd my-brilliant-idea

# Initialize .humanet folder
npx create-humanet

# Or if installed globally
humanet init
```

Follow the interactive prompts:
- Enter your idea name
- Provide a one-line description
- Select relevant domains (use space to select, enter to confirm)
- Enter your GitHub username
- Optionally provide repository URL
- Choose a license

The CLI creates the complete `.humanet/` folder structure with template files.

**Next:** Skip to [Step 7: Add Supporting Materials](#step-7-add-supporting-materials-optional) or run `humanet validate` to check your setup.

---

### Option B: Using GitHub Template

1. Visit [github.com/TheFakeCreator/.humanet](https://github.com/TheFakeCreator/.humanet)
2. Click **"Use this template"** → **"Create a new repository"**
3. Name your repository (e.g., `research-workflow-integrator`)
4. Clone it locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-idea-name.git
   cd your-idea-name
   ```

**Next:** Edit the files in the `.humanet/` folder starting with Step 3 below.

---

### Option C: Manual Setup (Learning Mode)

Create the structure manually to understand each component:

```bash
mkdir my-idea && cd my-idea
mkdir -p .humanet/{diagrams,research,discussions,evaluations,templates}
```

Continue with Step 3 to create each file...

## Step 3: Draft Problem Statement

Create `.humanet/problem_statement.md` with the following sections:

```markdown
# Problem Statement

## The Problem
[What problem exists? Be specific.]

Example: "Researchers spend 4-6 hours per week manually tracking 
papers across multiple platforms (arXiv, PubMed, Google Scholar). 
There's no unified way to organize, annotate, and share findings 
with collaborators."

## Who It Affects
[Who experiences this problem?]

Example: "Academic researchers, graduate students, and research 
teams in STEM fields who need to stay updated with literature."

## Current Impact
[What are the consequences?]

Example:
- Time wasted on manual tracking
- Important papers get missed
- Difficulty collaborating on literature reviews
- No systematic approach to knowledge management

## Why It Persists
[Why hasn't this been solved?]

Example: "Existing tools focus on single aspects (reference 
management OR discovery OR collaboration) but don't integrate 
the full workflow. Building comprehensive solutions requires 
expertise in multiple domains."

## Constraints
[What limitations exist?]

Example:
- Must respect academic publisher APIs and terms
- Privacy concerns with sharing unpublished research
- Need to work with existing reference managers
- Limited budget for infrastructure
```

**Time estimate:** 20-30 minutes

## Step 4: Describe Your Idea

Create `.humanet/idea.md` explaining your solution:

```markdown
# The Idea

## Core Concept
[High-level description in 2-3 sentences]

Example: "A unified research workflow platform that aggregates 
papers from multiple sources, provides AI-powered relevance 
filtering, and enables collaborative annotation and knowledge 
graph building."

## How It Works
[Explain the mechanism]

Example:
1. Users connect their preferred research databases
2. AI agents monitor for relevant papers based on interests
3. Papers are auto-categorized and summarized
4. Team members can annotate and discuss
5. Knowledge graph shows relationships between papers
6. Integrates with existing reference managers

## Key Features
1. **Multi-source aggregation** — arXiv, PubMed, Semantic Scholar
2. **AI relevance scoring** — Personalized recommendations
3. **Collaborative annotations** — Team discussion threads
4. **Knowledge graph** — Visual connections between papers
5. **Reference manager sync** — Zotero, Mendeley integration

## Differentiation
[What makes this unique?]

Example: "Unlike Zotero (just storage) or Google Scholar 
(just search), this integrates the entire workflow: discovery, 
filtering, organization, collaboration, and knowledge synthesis."

## Assumptions
[What are you assuming?]

Example:
- Researchers use multiple paper sources
- Teams want to collaborate on literature reviews
- AI can effectively judge paper relevance
- Users are willing to connect their accounts
```

**Time estimate:** 30-45 minutes

## Step 5: Define Scope

Create `.humanet/scope.md` to set boundaries:

```markdown
# Scope

## In Scope (MVP)
- [ ] Multi-source paper aggregation (3 sources)
- [ ] Basic AI relevance filtering
- [ ] Collaborative annotations
- [ ] Zotero integration
- [ ] Simple knowledge graph visualization
- [ ] Team workspaces

## Out of Scope (V1)
- Full-text paper analysis (future)
- Citation metrics and analytics (future)
- Mobile apps (web-first)
- Citation formatting/bibliography generation (use Zotero)
- Paper writing tools (use Overleaf/Word)
- Publisher access (assume open access/institutional)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Aggregate papers from 3+ sources successfully
- [ ] Users save 50%+ time on paper discovery
- [ ] 70%+ AI relevance accuracy (user feedback)
- [ ] 10+ collaborative annotation threads per team/month
- [ ] Integration works seamlessly with Zotero

## Milestones
1. **Phase 1 (Months 1-2)**: Paper aggregation & basic UI
2. **Phase 2 (Months 3-4)**: AI filtering & relevance scoring
3. **Phase 3 (Months 5-6)**: Collaboration features
4. **Phase 4 (Months 7-8)**: Knowledge graph & Zotero sync
5. **Phase 5 (Months 9-10)**: Beta testing & refinement
```

**Time estimate:** 15-20 minutes

## Step 6: Create README

Create `.humanet/README.md` as the entry point for your idea documentation:

```markdown
# Research Workflow Integrator

**Status:** Provisional  
**Domain:** Research Tools, AI/ML, Knowledge Management  
**Contributors:** [@yourusername]

## Overview

fragmented platforms with no systematic collaboration or knowledge 
synthesis tools.

## Solution

AI-powered aggregation platform with collaborative annotations and 
knowledge graph visualization.

## Documentation

- [Problem Statement](problem_statement.md)
- [The Idea](idea.md)
- [Scope & Milestones](scope.md)
- [Diagrams](diagrams/)

## Current Status

**Provisional Phase** — Drafting core documentation and gathering 
initial research.

## How to Contribute

- Include market research data
- Document use cases

**Time estimate:** Variable (30 minutes - 2 hours)

## Step 8: Review & Refine

Before submitting for evaluation:

### CLI Validation (Recommended)

If you used the CLI to initialize, run the validation command:

```bash
humanet validate

# For detailed output
humanet validate --verbose
```

This checks:
- All required files exist
- `config.yml` follows the schema
- YAML syntax is valid
- No placeholder text remains
- Files have minimum content

### Manual Self-Review Checklist

- [ ] `config.yml` is properly filled out
- [ ] Problem statement is specific and clear
- [ ] Solution directly addresses the problem
- [ ] Scope has measurable success criteria
- [ ] No placeholder or empty sections
- [ ] Internal consistency (no contradictions)
- [ ] Proper markdown formatting
- [ ] Files are properly linked in README

### Get Early Feedback

- Share with 2-3 trusted collaborators
- Ask specific questions:
  - "Is the problem clear?"
  - "Does the solution make sense?"
  - "What am I missing?"
- Iterate based on feedback

**Time estimate:** 30 minutes - 1 hour

## Step 9: Submit for Evaluation

Ready to validate your idea?

1. Click **"Submit for Evaluation"** in your idea repository
2. AI evaluator will review within 24 hours
3. You'll receive:
   - **Validated** status, or
   - **Vague** status with specific feedback

### If Marked Vague

Don't worry! This is normal. Review the feedback:

- **Common issues:**
  - Problem too broad → Make it more specific
  - Missing details → Add concrete examples
  - Unclear scope → Define boundaries better
  - Inconsistencies → Align documents

- **Action:** Address feedback and re-submit
- **Unlimited re-evaluations** during Provisional period

### If Validated

Congratulations! Your idea is now:
- Publicly visible
- Eligible for domain matching
- Ready for collaboration
- Part of the knowledge graph

## Step 10: Move to Active Development

Once validated:

1. Mark idea as **Active**
2. Start working on milestones
