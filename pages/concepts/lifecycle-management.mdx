# Lifecycle Management

Ideas in Humanet follow a **structured lifecycle** with clear states and validation at each stage. This ensures quality and prevents the platform from becoming cluttered with vague or abandoned ideas.

> **Implementation Note**
>
> The lifecycle system and AI-powered validation are currently under development. The documentation describes the planned workflow. For now, you can use the CLI and template to structure ideas following these guidelines manually.

## Lifecycle States

### Provisional

**Duration:** 30 days maximum  
**Purpose:** Initial development and documentation phase

When you create a new idea, it enters the **Provisional** state. This gives you time to:
- Draft required documentation
- Gather initial research
- Invite early collaborators
- Refine the problem and solution

**Requirements:**
- Must have all required files (`problem_statement.md`, `idea.md`, `scope.md`, `README.md`)
- Files must contain meaningful content (not placeholders)
- Must submit for evaluation before the 30-day window expires

**Actions Available:**
- Edit all documentation
- Invite collaborators
- Add research and artifacts
- Submit for evaluation (when ready)

**What Happens if You Don't Submit?**
- After 30 days, the idea automatically enters **Draft limbo**
- You receive notifications at days 20, 25, and 28
- You can request an extension (one-time, 15 additional days)
- After limbo, the idea is archived but can be revived

---

### Vague

**Purpose:** Indicates documentation needs improvement

If the AI evaluator determines your idea lacks clarity or completeness, it will be marked **Vague** with specific feedback.

**Common Reasons:**
- Problem statement is too broad or unclear
- Solution doesn't address the stated problem
- Missing critical information
- Success criteria are not measurable
- Inconsistencies between documents

**What to Do:**
1. Review the AI evaluation feedback
2. Address the specific concerns raised
3. Refine your documentation
4. Re-submit for evaluation

**Re-evaluation:**
- Unlimited re-submissions during Provisional period
- Each evaluation provides actionable feedback
- Can request human review if you disagree with AI assessment

---

### Validated

**Purpose:** Idea has passed quality gates and is ready for development

Congratulations! Your idea has been validated. This means:
- Documentation is clear and complete
- Problem and solution are well-defined
- Idea is sufficiently differentiated from existing ideas
- Success criteria are measurable

**Benefits:**
- Appears in public idea directory
- Eligible for domain matching and expert recommendations
- Can receive karma points
- Can be forked, branched, or merged
- Full access to collaboration features

**Actions Available:**
- Move to Active Development
- Allow forks and branches
- Domain-based collaboration matching
- Knowledge graph integration

---

### Active Development

**Purpose:** Idea is being actively worked on

Once validated, you can begin active development. This state indicates:
- Work is ongoing
- Collaborators are making regular contributions
- Milestones are being tracked
- Progress is documented

**Expectations:**
- Regular activity (commits, updates, discussions)
- Milestone tracking in `scope.md`
- Decision documentation
- Response to contributor questions

**Indicators of Activity:**
- Commits/updates in the last 30 days
- Open discussions or pull requests
- Meeting notes or decision logs
- Prototype or code development

**If Inactive for 60 Days:**
- Automatic notification to maintainers
- Community can request status update
- Option to mark as Dormant or open for adoption

---

### Dormant

**Purpose:** Temporarily paused, but may resume

Sometimes ideas need to be put on hold:
- Maintainer is unavailable
- Waiting for external dependencies
- Strategic pause for planning
- Resource constraints

**Requirements:**
- Must provide a reason and expected duration
- Maintain minimal documentation
- Respond to major questions/forks

**Benefits:**
- Won't be flagged as inactive
- Reserved in knowledge graph
- Can resume at any time
- Original maintainer retains ownership

**Open for Adoption:**
- Maintainer can mark as "Open for New Maintainer"
- Others can request to adopt the idea
- Original maintainer retains credit in family tree

---

### Archived (Complete)

**Purpose:** Idea has reached a natural conclusion

Mark an idea as **Archived** when:
- Goals have been achieved
- Project has been completed
- Implementation is successful
- No further development needed

**Characteristics:**
- Documentation becomes read-only
- Still visible in knowledge graph
- Can be forked or referenced
- Serves as a reference for future ideas

**Karma Bonus:**
- Successfully archived ideas receive completion karma
- All contributors receive attribution
- Featured in success stories

---

### Deprecated (Superseded)

**Purpose:** Idea has been replaced by a better approach

Mark as **Deprecated** when:
- A better solution has emerged
- The approach is no longer viable
- Superseded by a fork or merge
- Assumptions were proven wrong

**Requirements:**
- Must link to the superseding idea (if applicable)
- Explain why it was deprecated
- Document lessons learned

**Value:**
- Prevents others from pursuing dead ends
- Shows evolutionary path in family tree
- Lessons learned inform future ideas
- Maintains historical context

---

## Transitions Between States

### Provisional → Vague
- **Trigger:** Failed AI evaluation
- **Action:** Review feedback and refine

### Provisional → Validated
- **Trigger:** Passed AI evaluation
- **Action:** Idea becomes publicly visible

### Validated → Active
- **Trigger:** Manual transition by maintainer
- **Action:** Work begins, collaboration opens

### Active → Dormant
- **Trigger:** Manual pause or 60 days inactivity
- **Action:** Provide reason and timeline

### Active → Archived
- **Trigger:** Goals achieved
- **Action:** Document outcomes and lessons

### Active → Deprecated
- **Trigger:** Better solution found
- **Action:** Link to replacement, document reasoning

### Dormant → Active
- **Trigger:** Work resumes
- **Action:** Update status and roadmap

## Best Practices

### During Provisional
- Take time to research and draft thoroughly
- Get early feedback from trusted collaborators
- Use the full 30 days if needed
- Don't rush to submit incomplete documentation

### After Validation
- Regularly update progress
- Document decisions as you go
- Respond to collaborator questions
- Don't go silent for extended periods

### When Pausing
- Be transparent about timeline
- Consider marking "Open for Adoption"
- Respond to major questions
- Don't ghost the community

### When Completing
- Document lessons learned
- Celebrate achievements
- Link to implementations or results
- Thank contributors
