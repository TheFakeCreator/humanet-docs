# Getting Started with Humanet

Welcome to Humanet! This guide will help you understand the platform and create your first idea repository.

> **Platform Status**
>
> The Humanet platform is in active development. Currently available: CLI tool and GitHub template for structuring ideas. Coming soon: Web platform, AI validation system, collaboration features, and knowledge graph integration.

## What You'll Learn

1. Core concepts and terminology
2. How to create an idea repository
3. Required documentation structure
4. How ideas progress through lifecycles
5. How to collaborate with others

## Prerequisites

Before you start:
- Understanding of version control concepts (Git/GitHub helpful but not required)
- Markdown knowledge (basic formatting)
- Clear problem you want to solve or idea you want to develop
- Node.js 18+ installed (for CLI method)

## Quick Start Options

Choose your preferred method to create an idea:

### Option 1: CLI (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started:

```bash
npx create-humanet
```

The CLI will guide you through an interactive setup, creating all required files and folder structure automatically.

**Advantages:**
- Interactive prompts guide you through setup
- Validates your input as you go
- Creates proper folder structure instantly
- Built-in validation with `humanet validate`

### Option 2: GitHub Template

Use the official template repository:

1. Visit [github.com/TheFakeCreator/.humanet](https://github.com/TheFakeCreator/.humanet)
2. Click "Use this template" → "Create a new repository"
3. Name your repository and clone it locally
4. Edit the template files with your idea details

**Advantages:**
- Works without Node.js
- Full GitHub integration from the start
- Pre-configured structure

### Option 3: Manual Setup

Clone the template and customize manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheFakeCreator/.humanet.git my-idea
cd my-idea
rm -rf .git
git init
```

Then edit all files in the `.humanet/` folder.

## Understanding the Basics

### What is an Idea Repository?

An idea repository is like a GitHub repository, but for ideas instead of code. It contains:

- **Structured documentation** — Required files that define your idea
- **Supporting artifacts** — Research, diagrams, prototypes, discussions
- **Version history** — Track how your idea evolves over time
- **Collaboration space** — Work with others transparently

### The Idea Lifecycle

Ideas aren't static. They evolve through stages:

```
Provisional (30 days)
    ↓
AI Evaluation
    ↓
Validated
    ↓
Active Development
    ↓
Complete/Archived
```

Each stage has specific requirements and validation criteria.

## Your First Idea

Ready to create your first idea? 

**Using the CLI:**
