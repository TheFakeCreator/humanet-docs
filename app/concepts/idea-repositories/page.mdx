# Idea Repositories

Every idea in Humanet lives as a **structured repository** with standardized documentation and optional supporting artifacts.

## What is an Idea Repository?

Think of it as a GitHub repository, but optimized for the ideation and planning phase. It contains:

- **Required documentation** that defines the problem and solution
- **Optional artifacts** like research, diagrams, and prototypes
- **Version history** showing how the idea evolved
- **Collaboration logs** of discussions and decisions
- **Metadata** like domains, contributors, and lifecycle stage

## Required Files (Provisional Phase)

Every new idea repository must include these files:

### `problem_statement.md`

**Purpose:** Define the problem you're solving

**Key questions to answer:**
- What problem exists today?
- Who experiences this problem?
- What is the impact of this problem?
- Why hasn't it been solved yet?
- What constraints exist?

**Template:**
```markdown
# Problem Statement

## The Problem
[Clear description of the problem]

## Who It Affects
[Target users/audience/stakeholders]

## Current Impact
[Consequences of the problem existing]

## Why It Persists
[Barriers to solving it]

## Constraints
[Technical, financial, social, or other limitations]
```

### `idea.md`

**Purpose:** Describe your proposed solution

**Key questions to answer:**
- What is your core concept?
- How does it solve the problem?
- What makes it different/better?
- What are the key features or components?
- What assumptions are you making?

**Template:**
```markdown
# The Idea

## Core Concept
[High-level description of your solution]

## How It Works
[Explanation of the mechanism/approach]

## Key Features
1. [Feature 1]
2. [Feature 2]
3. [Feature 3]

## Differentiation
[What makes this unique or better than alternatives]

## Assumptions
[What you're assuming to be true]
```

### `scope.md`

**Purpose:** Define boundaries and success criteria

**Key questions to answer:**
- What is in scope?
- What is explicitly out of scope?
- Who are the primary users?
- What defines success?
- What are the key milestones?

**Template:**
```markdown
# Scope

## In Scope
- [What this idea includes]
- [Core features]
- [Target audience]

## Out of Scope
- [What this idea does NOT include]
- [Future considerations]
- [Deliberate exclusions]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 2]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 3]

## Milestones
1. **[Phase 1]**: [Description]
2. **[Phase 2]**: [Description]
3. **[Phase 3]**: [Description]
```

### `README.md`

**Purpose:** Entry point and navigation for collaborators

**Should include:**
- Brief overview (2-3 sentences)
- Links to key files
- Current status/lifecycle stage
- How to contribute
- Contact information

## Optional Files & Artifacts

### Research Materials
- `research/` — Papers, articles, case studies
- `literature-review.md` — Summary of existing research
- `market-analysis.md` — Competitive landscape

### Design & Planning
- `architecture.md` — System design and structure
- `diagrams/` — Visual representations (see [Diagramming Standards](/standards/diagramming))
- `user-stories.md` — Use cases and scenarios
- `technical-spec.md` — Detailed technical planning

### Data & Analysis
- `datasets/` — Relevant datasets
- `data-analysis.md` — Findings and insights
- `experiments/` — Simulation results, prototypes

### Collaboration
- `discussions/` — Discussion threads on specific topics
- `decisions.md` — Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- `meeting-notes/` — Meeting summaries
- `contributors.md` — List of contributors and roles

### Code & Prototypes
- `prototypes/` — Proof-of-concept implementations
- `experiments/` — Code experiments
- `simulations/` — Simulation scripts and results

## Best Practices

### Documentation
- **Be concise** — Aim for clarity over length
- **Use markdown** — Consistent formatting aids readability
- **Link liberally** — Connect related documents and discussions
- **Update regularly** — Keep docs synchronized with decisions

### Organization
- **Meaningful names** — Use descriptive file and folder names
- **Flat when possible** — Don't over-nest directories
- **README everywhere** — Add README.md to subdirectories
- **Separate concerns** — Group related files logically

### Collaboration
- **Document decisions** — Capture why choices were made
- **Thread discussions** — Link discussions to files they generated
- **Attribute contributions** — Give credit in commit messages
- **Version milestones** — Tag significant versions

## Validation Requirements

For an idea to progress from **Provisional** to **Validated**, the AI evaluator checks:

- All required files exist and are non-empty
- Problem statement is clear and specific
- Idea addresses the stated problem
- Scope is well-defined with measurable success criteria
- Documentation is internally consistent
- Idea is sufficiently differentiated from existing ideas

See [Quality Control](/concepts/quality-control) for detailed evaluation criteria.
