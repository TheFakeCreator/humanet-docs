# Humanet Documentation

**GitHub for Ideas + Notion for Structure + Obsidian's Knowledge Graph**

Welcome to Humanet, a structured collaboration platform that treats ideas like code—with versioning, lifecycle management, quality validation, and knowledge graph connections.

> **Note:** Humanet is currently under active development. Not all features are available yet, but the core ecosystem is taking shape.

## Quick Start

Get started with Humanet in under a minute:

## Core Concepts

### Idea Repositories

Every idea lives in a structured repository with standardized files: problem statement, solution design, scope definition, and README. This ensures clarity and consistency across all ideas.

### Lifecycle Management

Ideas progress through a well-defined lifecycle: Provisional (newly created) → AI Evaluation → Validated (clear and actionable) → Active (being worked on) → Dormant/Archived/Deprecated. Each state has specific requirements and transitions.

### Standards & Quality

Humanet enforces quality through required documentation, AI validation, and standardized diagramming (using Draw.io). Ideas must be clear, scoped, and actionable before moving forward.

## Why Humanet?

**For Individuals:** Never lose track of your ideas. Document them properly, validate their clarity, and see how they connect to your other work.

**For Teams:** Collaborate on ideas with the same rigor as code. Review, discuss, and evolve ideas systematically.

**For Organizations:** Build a knowledge graph of validated ideas. Track what's being worked on, what's completed, and what's shelved.
